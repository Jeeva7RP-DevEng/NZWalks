## Security Best Practices

To help maintain security, we enforce the following:
- **Dependency Management:** We use the latest versions of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (9.0.2)`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools (9.0.2)`, and `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (6.6.2)`. Ensure all dependencies are up to date.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement proper authentication mechanisms using **JWT tokens** or **OAuth2.0**.
- **Database Security:** Use **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection and configure **secure database connections**.
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure all API communication is secured via HTTPS.
- **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data (e.g., connection strings, API keys) in environment variables, not in source code.

For any security concerns, feel free to reach out to the maintainers. Thank you for helping keep NZWalks API secure! ðŸš€
